# RW Research
Purely educational research

## Notes
  1. This is only meant to be used for a very specific case study
  2. Everything here assumes that this entire repository has been downloaded via a backdoor
  3. This repository should be placed in the directory that contains the files that are to be encrypted or decrypted
  4. At the moment, only `index.php` and `*.txt` files are handled
